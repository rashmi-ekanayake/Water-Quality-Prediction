# Water-Quality-Prediction
This machine learning project predicts water potability based on physicochemical properties like pH, Hardness, Solids, and more. The model is trained using a water quality dataset with features such as Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, and Turbidity. It aims to support water safety analysis by classifying samples as potable or non-potable.
